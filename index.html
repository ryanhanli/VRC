                                What exactly is going on in Venezuela?

                            <p>
                                The Venezuelan refugee and migration crisis (also sometimes referred to as the Bolivarian diaspora), refers to the emigration of millions of Venezuelans from their native country during the presidencies of Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro due to the Bolivarian Revolution (a movement led by Hugo Chávez to implement more socialist policies in Venezuela).  With more than 5 million Venezuelans having already fled the country, it is considered the  largest recorded refugee crisis in the Americas.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, unlike many refugee situations, the Venezuelan refugee crisis defies the conventional understanding of what drives people to leave their country en masse.  "According to the 1951 Refugee Convention, a refugee is someone with a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a social group or political opinion. While some of the people leaving Venezuela fit into that category, it does not apply to the majority of those who have fled. Nor does the conventional definition of a migrant, someone who voluntarily leaves his or her country of origin in order to seek a better life and who does not face impediments to returning home." <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/understanding-the-venezuelan-refugee-crisis" target= "_blank">[2]</a>

                    <h2><strong>Why are people leaving Venezuela?</strong></h2>
                    <p class="text-intro">
                        With such a high number of refugees, the Venezuelan refugee crisis is only second to the Syrian refugee crisis, but what are the drivers of Venezuelan migration?
                    </p>
                    <p>Venezuelans are fleeing because of a profound political and economic crisis in Venezuela.  These crises are characterized by the systematic violation of human rights and a deepening humanitarian emergency. This humanitarian crisis, "manifest in widespread poverty and chronic shortages of food, medicine, and other basic necessities, is the product of years of economic mismanagement and official corruption as well as a sharp decline in oil prices between 2013 and 2016." <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/understanding-the-venezuelan-refugee-crisis" target= "_blank">[3]</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Venezuelan economy has depended on oil for a long time (99% of all export revenue and 35% of GDP), and thus the country is very vulnerable to fluctuations in the global market.  The price of oil tumbled from $97.5 per barrel in 2013—when Nicolás Maduro assumed the presidency following Chávez’s death—to a mere $34.7 per barrel in 2016, the lowest price in more than a decade.  Furthermore, the economy contracted 45 percent between 2013 and 2018. </p>

                    <h2><strong>More Reasons to Leave</strong></h2>
                    <p class="text-intro">“We left everything in Venezuela. We don’t have a place to live or sleep and have nothing to eat.” –Nayebis Carolina Figuera, a 34-year-old from Venezuela who fled to neighbouring Brazil</p>
                    <p>The loss of income earning opportunities, combined with an inflation rate that is predicted to reach 10 million percent this year, has made daily life a struggle for survival for the majority of the population. "According to ENCOVI, a household survey carried out by four leading Venezuelan universities, 94 percent of the population was living below the poverty line in 2018. In June 2019, the research center CENDA calculated that the minimum wage was worth $5.43 a month, which could only purchase 2.8 percent of the basic food basket for a family of five." <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/understanding-the-venezuelan-refugee-crisis" target= "_blank">[3]</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, the country faces constant blackouts and power failures due to the crumbling economy.  Food is also extremely scarce and prohibitively expensive due to the price controls set by the Chávez and Maduro administrations. Similarly, the healthcare sector has collapsed with 85% of essential medicines being considered scarce. Violent crimes are also at an all time high and armed forces have the permission to use excessive force for political purposes.</p>

                            <p>
                                Similar to the Syrian refugee crisis,  the vast majority of those who have fled in the Venezuelan refugee crisis are living in other countries of the region. As of August 2019, the main receiving countries are Colombia (1.4 million), Peru (853,400), Chile (288,200), and Ecuador (330,400). While hosting a smaller number of Venezuelans in total, small island states in the Caribbean have received the most in relative terms. In Aruba (16,000) and Curaçao (26,000), Venezuelans represent more than 15 percent of the population, creating intense competition for employment and posing a significant challenge to government institutions. <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/understanding-the-venezuelan-refugee-crisis" target= "_blank">[3]</a>

                                "The two countries outside the region that host the most Venezuelans are Spain, which had 323,575 at the beginning of 2019, and the United States, which had 351,144 in 2017, the most recent date for which data is available. In both countries, Venezuela has become the main source of asylum petitions. In January, 31 percent of all claims filed with the United States Citizenship and Immigration services were from Venezuelans, a far greater number than the petitions received from Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras." <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/understanding-the-venezuelan-refugee-crisis" target= "_blank">[3]</a>

                  <h2><strong>Lack of Attention</strong></h2>
                  <p class="text-intro">Why hasn't much been heard about the Venezuelan refugee crisis?</p>
                  <p>As previously mentioned, one of the reasons why the crisis in Venezuela has not received as much attention or funding as crises in countries like Syria and South Sudan is that it was not caused by an armed conflict. The majority of Venezuelans are therefore not considered refugees by their host countries, and many of them do not view themselves as such, either.</p>
                  <p>There is also a considerable gap when it comes to funding from the international community compared to the Syrian refugee crisis. "Funding for the Syrian refugees has been over 10 times larger than for Venezuelans, in per capita terms." <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2021/02/26/venezuelan-refugees-and-their-receiving-communities-need-funding-not-sympathy/" target= "_blank">[4]</a></p>

                            <p class="text-intro">
                                What can we expect from the Venezuelan refugee crisis as we move forward?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Unfortunately, there is no reason to believe that the massive Venezuelan displacement flows will abate anytime soon, so long as Maduro continues to hold power and the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate.

                                The international community has largely been able to ignore this escalating catastrophe by labeling it as a regional crisis instead of a global one. The crisis is politically complex, protracted, and involves over 17 regional host nations. A key first step in tackling this problem involves greater coordination between host nations and donors. To achieve this, however, the countries of the region need a massive influx of funding from the international community. This funding is required for humanitarian needs, investment in local communities and businesses that require infrastructure upgrades, and access to credit to absorb and integrate the immigrants and refugees into the formal labor force. <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2019/12/09/venezuela-refugee-crisis-to-become-the-largest-and-most-underfunded-in-modern-history/" target= "_blank">[8]</a>

                                 We acknowledge this might be even more difficult to achieve during a global recession, but that doesn’t change the reality. The numbers speak for themselves. The Venezuelan refugee crisis has already reached a global scale. It now requires a global response.
